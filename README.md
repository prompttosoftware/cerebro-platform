## 7. Getting Started (Development Setup)

Detailed setup instructions for a local development environment will be provided in `DEVELOPMENT.md`. This will typically involve:
1.  Cloning the repository.
2.  Setting up Docker and Docker Compose.
3.  Configuring environment variables.
4.  Running database migrations.
5.  Starting all services via Docker Compose.
6.  Running the frontend development server.

## 8. Data Management

*   **Primary Database:** PostgreSQL 14+ for all relational data.
*   **Caching:** Redis for distributed caching, session management, and rate limiting.
*   **File Storage:** AWS S3 for unstructured data (attachments, media).
*   **Schema Migration:** Alembic for managing database schema changes.
*   **Backup & Restore:** Automated daily backups (AWS RDS snapshots, S3 versioning).
*   **Replication:** PostgreSQL read replicas for read-heavy services.

## 9. Error Handling & Edge Cases

*   Standardized API error responses (HTTP status codes, structured JSON payloads).
*   Strict input validation (Pydantic).
*   Service resilience: retries with exponential backoff, circuit breakers.
*   Dead Letter Queues (DLQ) for RabbitMQ.

## 10. Security Considerations

*   **Authentication & Authorization:** JWTs, RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).
*   **Data Encryption:** At rest (PostgreSQL, S3) and in transit (HTTPS/TLS).
*   **Input Validation:** Comprehensive server-side validation.
*   **API Security:** Rate limiting, secure API key management.
*   **Secrets Management:** Kubernetes Secrets, AWS Secrets Manager.
*   **Least Privilege:** Grant minimum necessary permissions.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Automated scanning of dependencies.

## 11. Performance & Scalability

*   **Microservices:** Horizontal scaling of individual services.
*   **Load Balancing:** Kubernetes Ingress, AWS ALB.
*   **Caching:** Redis to reduce database load.
*   **Asynchronous Processing:** RabbitMQ for decoupled, responsive workflows.
*   **Database Optimization:** Indexing, query optimization, connection pooling.

## 12. Deployment & Infrastructure

*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform or AWS CloudFormation for provisioning AWS resources.
*   **Containerization:** All services Dockerized.
*   **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (EKS) for deployment, scaling, and management.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** GitHub Actions for automated build, test, and deployment to staging and production environments.

## 13. Testing Strategy

Cerebro employs a robust Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach with a comprehensive testing hierarchy:

*   **Unit Tests:** Verify isolated components (functions, modules). (`pytest`, `Jest`, `React Testing Library`).
*   **Integration Tests:** Verify interactions between components/services, including database and message queue interactions. Use `testcontainers` for real DB/MQ instances in CI. (`pytest`, `httpx`, `TestClient`, `msw`).
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Simulate critical user journeys to verify full system functionality. (`Cypress`, `Playwright`).

Mocking is strategically applied at system boundaries (external APIs, third-party libraries) to ensure efficient and reliable tests.

## 14. Monitoring & Logging

*   **Centralized Logging:** ELK Stack / AWS CloudWatch Logs for aggregated, structured logs.
*   **Metrics:** Prometheus for time-series metrics (service health, request rates, latency) and Grafana for dashboards.
*   **Alerting:** Prometheus Alertmanager for critical incident notifications.
*   **Tracing:** OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing across microservices.

## 15. Dependencies

*   **Internal:** Inter-service API calls and RabbitMQ events.
*   **External Cloud Services:** AWS (EKS, RDS, S3, ElastiCache etc.).
*   **Third-Party APIs:** Mail/SMS gateways (SendGrid/Twilio), Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, etc.
*   **Open Source Libraries/Frameworks:** Python (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, pytest, scikit-learn), JavaScript (React, TypeScript, Vite, Jest, Cypress, msw).
*   **Core Systems:** PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ.

## 16. Potential Risks & Mitigations

*   **Data Privacy & Compliance:** Implement data encryption, access controls, audit trails, and data subject rights features.
*   **AI Model Accuracy & Bias:** Rigorous data quality, regular retraining, performance monitoring, and explainable AI.
*   **Integration Complexity:** Standardized patterns, modular design, robust error handling, and proactive monitoring.
*   **Microservices Overhead:** Centralized CI/CD, comprehensive monitoring, standardized templates, and strong DevOps.
*   **Security Vulnerabilities:** Regular audits, automated scanning, least privilege, and adherence to security best practices.
